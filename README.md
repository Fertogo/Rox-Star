# Rox Star
Rox Star is a virtual reality karaoke experience with an immersive, reactive environment and professional vocal effects. Built with Unity and Reaper, this software leverages technologies such as virtual reality, motion tracking, and computer graphics to bring karaoke into this century!

We used a Samsung Gear VR and a Kinect to place the user on a virtual stage in Unity. Motion tracking, crowd simulation, lyrics streaming, and gesture detection were written in Unity.

For vocal enhancements, we used VSTs such as AutoTune, Reverb, Chorus, and automatic harmonization in Reaper.

For lyrics synchronization, we used a variation of the industry standard LRC format with augmented fields for light and audience cues.

Since this project was written in Unity, it ports easily to any platform.
